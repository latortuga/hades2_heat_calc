# Hades 2 Fear Calculator/Randomizer

Inspired by the [Hades 1 randomizer](https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/jmavip/heat_randomizercalculator/), I made a website for creating / randomizing Oath of the Unseen runs in Hades 2:

[Hades 2 Fear Calculator/Randomizer](https://18praveenb.github.io/hades2_heat_calc/)

* Change fear values and create shareable link to a specific setup.
* Randomize fear values to create a run with specified fear target. (You can also lock values to exclude them from randomization.)

Please let me know if there are any bugs, issues, or incorrect data!
